Electronics engineer turned Software engineer from Belgium, and working remotely for 4 years and running.

My biggest passion is probably OSS, but specifically I love working on tooling and functional libraries.
I'vee been working on [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) for over 5 years, some other smaller libraries, and I try to contribute to the many libraries I use during my regular day-to-day work.

Started out as an Android developer, but quickly became a polygot through my interest in all kinds of paradigms, language, working on tooling, libraries, backend, etc.

Kotlin has been my main language since 2015, many years with Java right alongside it and in my spare time I've also spend serveral years learning Scala as inspiration for FP.

On this informal blog I hope to share some of my experiences of what I've learned and continue to learn on my day-to-day and personal work. I hope you enjoy it!
