Currently, I am looking for employment in Data Scientist roles. I enjoy solving problems with Data Analysis and creating fancy Data Visualizations. Throughout my Ph.D., I worked closely with data: doing multiparticle simulations of electron beams and tracking their real space and momentum space coordinates of up to 10000 particles, or analyzing time-series electron diffraction images. These projects involve Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, and Data Manipulation of large data sets (few Gb) and fitting them into theoretical models. I have been coding in Python for 10+ years and taught it for undergraduate courses. I am also knowledgeable in SQL, Tableau, and Excel. In addition to those technical skills I mentioned, I am very comfortable presenting my work to a technical and lay audience, and I have lots of experience writing technical reports. 

Aside from my professional skills, I am a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (having achieved the rank of purple belt) and Muay Thai. I enjoy going on long backcountry canoe camping trips in the summer. During the pandemic, I was so bored at home that I decided to take up woodworking :p. I always enjoy working with my hands, whether it’s building something from scratch or fixing things around the laboratory during my Ph.D. or at home.

Relevant Experience
----------

**Your Most Recent Work Experience:**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
