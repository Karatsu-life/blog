Thanks for dropping by! I've migrated from an old blog, so this site is a work in progress ðŸ’ª

I live in New Zealand and currently work as a Data Scientist at a mental health AI startup called [chnnl](http://chnnl.app). You can expect to see posts about data science, software development, mental health and various other things going on in my world. 

Feel free to connect with me on linkedin or email. Links to those are in the footer below.

Happy browsing! ðŸ’»
