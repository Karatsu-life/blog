Thanks for dropping by! I've migrated from an old blog, so this site is a work in progress ðŸ’ª

I live in New Zealand and currently work as a Data Scientist at a mental health AI startup called [chnnl](http://chnnl.app). You can expect to see posts about data science, software development, mental health and various other things going on in my world. 

Other facts about me: I was born and lived most of my life in the PhilippinesðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. I have an extensive boardgame collection, love food and cooking, and really enjoy learning about the world around me. I try to be active within New Zealand's Data Science community--I recently moderated a panel for women data scientists in New Zealand, for example, and have speaking involvements with the University of Auckland's Data Science Club.

Feel free to connect with me on linkedin, instagram or email in the footer below.

Happy browsing! ðŸ’»
