This is my personal blog which cover any topic of science, the history of science or research integrity that catches my interest. It is intended to hold arguments or musings too long for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MagnusPalmblad) but too short, or unimportant, to be published in a scientific journal. I am creating this blog with the intention to publish at least one major post per month, with minor updates weekly. The blog may also feature occasional guest bloggers and links to other blogs.

For those interested in the technical details, I can tell you that the blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and based on the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme, which itself is a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
