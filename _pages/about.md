# About me

Currently, I am looking for employment in Data Scientist roles. I enjoy solving problems with Data Analysis and creating fancy Data Visualizations. Throughout my Ph.D., I worked closely with data: doing multiparticle simulations of electron beams and tracking their real space and momentum space coordinates of up to 10000 particles, or analyzing time-series electron diffraction images. These projects involve Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, and Data Manipulation of large data sets (few Gb) and fitting them into theoretical models. I have been coding in Python for 10+ years and taught it for undergraduate courses. I am also knowledgeable in SQL, Tableau, and Excel. In addition to those technical skills I mentioned, I am very comfortable presenting my work to a technical and lay audience, and I have lots of experience writing technical reports. 

Aside from my professional skills, I am a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (having achieved the rank of purple belt) and Muay Thai. I enjoy going on long backcountry canoe camping trips in the summer. During the pandemic, I was so bored at home that I decided to take up woodworking :p. I always enjoy working with my hands, whether itâ€™s building something from scratch or fixing things around the laboratory during my Ph.D. or at home.
