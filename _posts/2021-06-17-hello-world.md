[Hello World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) This is my first post on this blog, which will cover any topic of science, history of science or research integrity that catches my interest. While I like and try to be as active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MagnusPalmblad) as time permits, I sometimes find myself wanting to expand an argument, providing additional background or reasoning. As I am not a fan of creating long and clumsy Twitter threads, and not every argument deserves an opinion piece in a scientific journal, I am creating this blog with the intention to publish at least one major blogpost at the end of every month, with minor updates every week. The blog may also feature occasional guest bloggers and links to other blogs.

For those interested in the technical details, I can tell you that the blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and based on the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme, which itself is a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
