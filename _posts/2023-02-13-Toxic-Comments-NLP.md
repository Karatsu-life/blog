The internet has become an integral part of modern society and has greatly impacted the way we communicate and access information. While it provides many benefits, it also has its downsides, one of which is the prevalence of toxic comments. In this project, I attempt to solve the problem we have with toxicity on the internet by building a machine learning model that detects and filters these toxic comments.

# Introduction: Why toxic comment filtering is important?

The internet has become an integral part of modern society and has greatly impacted the way we communicate and access information. While it provides many benefits, it also has its downsides, one of which is the prevalence of toxic comments. Toxic comments are comments that are harmful, offensive, or disruptive to a particular community or individual. They can take many forms, such as hate speech, personal attacks, and bullying.

It is important to filter out toxic comments on the internet because they can seriously impact individuals and communities. For example, toxic comments can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, especially among young people who are still developing their sense of identity. This can cause long-lasting harm to their mental health and well-being. In some cases, toxic comments can even lead to self-harm or suicide. Moreover, toxic comments can also create an unhealthy and hostile environment for communities. They can drive away members, stifle creativity and innovation, and negatively impact the overall quality of a platform. This can lead to a decline in user engagement and satisfaction, which can have serious consequences for online businesses and websites. It is also important to consider the larger social implications of toxic comments. They can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, discrimination, and prejudice, and contribute to a divisive and toxic online culture. This can have a ripple effect on offline communities, leading to further social and political polarization.
